# simple-shell
A simple shell program written in Rust. The program specification follows the [UCLA CS 111 Project 1 Spec](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall19/cs111/assign/lab1.html). I took this 
class in university, and we were asked to write our solutions in C. I am reimplenting it in Rust to learn the language's capabilities, as well as to gain experience using tools such as 
cargo, Github workflows, and crates.
